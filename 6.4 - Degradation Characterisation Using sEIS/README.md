**Instructions**



**To get results in main manuscript, Section 6.4** 



1. Generate KL SEI Growth Degradation and sEIS Data 



-> Open Long\_Ageing\_Cycler

-> Set SEI = 1 in line 7. To select the KL SEI Degradation Model

-> Run Long\_Ageing\_Cycler



2\. Generate DL SEI Growth Degradation and sEIS Data



-> Open Long\_Ageing\_Cycler

-> Set SEI = 2 in line 7. To select the DL SEI Degradation Model

-> Run Long\_Ageing\_Cycler



3\. Generate the Cycling Results of Figure (15).



-> Open Cycling\_Results\_Plotter

-> Run Cycling\_Results\_Plotter



4\. Generate the sEIS Characterisation Results for KL SEI growth (Figure (16))



-> Open Degradation\_Plot\_Generator

-> Set SEI\_con = 1 in line 14. To select the KL SEI Degradation Model

-> Run Degradation\_Plot\_Generator



5\. Generate the sEIS Characterisation Results for DL SEI growth (Figure (17))



-> Open Degradation\_Plot\_Generator

-> Set SEI\_con = 2 in line 14. To select the DL SEI Degradation Model

-> Run Degradation\_Plot\_Generator
